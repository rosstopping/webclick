## Developing your template


Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-template
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

This will setup a localhost dev server and will continue to watch for file changes.

Alternatively if you do not want to watch for changes you can run the following command.

```bash
  npm run build
```
## Host your template on Netlify

We recommend [Netlify](https://netlify.com) as a way of hosting your static site. It's free to sign up and use for small hobby websites.

### Upload your GIT repository
Once you've signed up for an account on Netlify, you'll need to also upload your website to [Github](https://github.com) (or similar). Create a new empty repo and upload all your files.

``` bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Connect your Netlify account to your GIT repository
Click 'new site from git' while logged in, you'll be asked to connect your github account. once your account has been connected you'll be able to select your newly created repository and Netlify will do the rest.
